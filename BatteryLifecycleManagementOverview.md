# Battery lifecycle management using Azure Digital Twins
A battery is a key component in electric products because it enormously influences user experience. OEMs try to monitor and analyze a product’s battery condition for finding insights while an end-user is using it. As battery life is variable by usage environment and habit, OEMs reflect those insights into battery life enhancements.
This article is an example of an end-to-end solution for battery lifecycle management in mobility industry. It discusses how to manage each user’s battery lifecycle through Azure Digital Twins. 

# Architecture

# Workflow
1. A product/device gathers and sends telemetry data such as battery’s current, voltage, SOC (State of Charge), location, etc. to IoT Hub. In terms of device management and operation, OEMs could use their own telematics platform or develop a consumer telematics solution based on Azure IoT SDK, Azure Sphere, Azure/Free RTOS and Azure IoT Edge.
2.  Azure Functions distributes messages to each product’s Azure Digital Twin instances. A message needs to include identification such as product ID for routing and updating a message to a right twin instance through [Azure Digital Twins APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data).
3. Azure Digital Twins receives messages in Azure Digital Twins models, [ontology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-ontologies) and handles [event notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-event-notifications) using Azure Event Grid.
4. Azure Functions and [Azure SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-integrate-azure-signalr) services push digital twin telemetry data to connected clients such as a single web page, a mobile application and Azure Maps. Azure SignalR supports updating real-time metrics and status to clients without polling servers or submitting HTTP requests.
5. Azure Digital Twins provides an integration feature, [data history](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-data-history), that allows Azure Data Explorer historize property updates and time series data. 
6. Once ingested Azure Digital Twins data into Azure Data Explorer, a data analyst or scientist can query historical data of Azure Data Explorer time series database using [KQL (Kusto Query Language)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) with a chart or graph. [Azure Digital Twin query plugin for Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-data-explorer-plugin) lets users combine and query data across the Azure Digital Twins graph and Azure Data Explorer time series databases.
7. A dashboard with near-real time updates gives a user an insight that helps decide on industry KPIs such as [SOC (State of Charge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge), [SOH (State of Health)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_health) and [RUL (Remaining Useful Life)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognostics) of a battery. Power BI, Grafana and Azure Data Explorer Web UI allow to connect various data sources and visualize analytics dashboards.
8. Data scientists can build machine learning models that predict battery conditions such as SOH and RUL using advanced analytics tools, Azure Machine Learning and Azure Data Bricks.
9. The machine learning models can be deployed to Azure Services, Azure Container Instance, Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Functions. Azure Digital Twins sends near-real time telemetry to a machine learning model and gets back an inference result and update it in Azure Digital Twins’ property through Azure Functions.

# Alternatives
-	If you have your own IoT platform or streaming data platform such as Kafka, it can connect to Azure Digital Twins through Azure Functions.
-	Instead of Azure SignalR, MQTT broker service enables real-time communication to web applications whenever Azure Digital Twins is changed.
-	There are professional solutions for battery life prediction. If you simulate battery systems with 3rd party solutions, you can integrate it with Azure Digital Twins for Advance Analytics.

# Scenario details
Modeling a battery ontology of Azure Digital Twins needs domain knowledge in a battery and product. It doesn’t need to exactly follow physical product structure. A manufacturer can define their own battery ontology considering of component’s properties and telemetries.

In the case of a vehicle, a battery system consists of pack, modules and cells. The minimum unit is a cell which is container to store energy. Multiple cells are grouped together to form a module. Multiple modules are grouped together to form a pack.
